# Diffchestrator — VS Code Extension

> **Built for Claude Code.** Multi-repo Git orchestration designed as a companion to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Anthropic's CLI for agentic coding. Stage, review, and commit across repos without leaving VS Code, then hand off to Claude for AI-powered commits, code reviews, and multi-repo workflows.

## Why Diffchestrator?

Claude Code works best when you can see what it changed, across every repo it touched. Diffchestrator gives you that visibility: a sidebar tree of all your repos, real-time change tracking, one-click diffs, and direct terminal integration with `claude`. No context switching, no manual `git status` in twelve terminals.

## Features

### Claude Code Integration
- **AI Commit** — runs `claude --permission-mode acceptEdits` in the repo's terminal for real-time output (`Ctrl+D, C`)
- **Open Claude Code** — launches `claude -c` to continue the previous session, or `claude --add-dir` for multiple selected repos (`Ctrl+D, L`)
- **Yolo** — opens terminal and runs the `yolo` alias from claude-sandbox (`Ctrl+D, Y`)
- **Ask Claude** button per diff hunk in the multi-repo diff webview
- **Per-repo terminal tracking** — each repo tracks its own Claude, Yolo, and shell terminals independently. Switching repos auto-switches the terminal panel to the correct session.
- **Terminal reuse** — `Ctrl+D, L` and `Ctrl+D, Y` reuse existing sessions instead of spawning new ones

### Active Repos & Workspace Switching
- **Active Repos view** — sidebar section showing recent repos (MRU, up to 10) with live terminal status indicators
- **Persisted across reloads** — active repos and selection survive VS Code restarts
- **Cycle repos** — `Ctrl+D, Tab` cycles through all recent repos (like Alt+Tab but for repos), switching the changed files view, terminal, and diff editor in one keystroke
- **Close active repos** — `Ctrl+D, Q` closes current, `Ctrl+D, Shift+Q` picks which to close, `Ctrl+D, Shift+Tab` closes all
- **Terminal indicators** — each repo shows which terminal types are running (Claude, Yolo, Shell)
- **Auto-switch terminal** — clicking a repo in Active Repos, Favorites, or Repositories auto-surfaces that repo's terminal (priority: Claude > Yolo > Shell)
- **Terminal tab sync** — clicking a terminal tab (Claude, Yolo, shell) auto-selects the repo in the sidebar, opens its changed files, and adds it to Active Repos if not already there
- **Auto-add on terminal open** — opening a terminal, Claude Code, or Yolo session for a repo automatically adds it to Active Repos
- **Notifications** — notifies when Claude commits or modifies files in any repo, with "Show Terminal" and "View Changes" action buttons (changes notification debounced 15s to avoid mid-edit alerts)

### Repository Discovery
- **Auto-scan** a root directory to discover all git repos (BFS, configurable depth)
- **Auto-scan workspace folders** on startup if no roots configured, and when new folders are added
- **Skip directories** like `node_modules`, `.terraform`, `vendor`, `build`, etc. (configurable)
- **Changed-only filter** — toggle to show only repos with uncommitted changes (`Ctrl+D, D`)
- **Changed repos sort first** in the tree for quick access

### Sidebar Views
- **Active Repos** — recently opened repos with terminal status, active repo highlighted in blue
- **Changed Files** — staged/unstaged/untracked files for the selected repo, grouped by status
- **Favorites** — pin repos for quick access with `Ctrl+D, E`; active repo highlighted with blue star
- **Repositories** — hierarchical tree with common path prefix collapsing, change count badges
- **View descriptions** — active repo name + branch shown next to "Changed Files" title
- **Activity bar badge** — total change count across all repos
- **Tooltips** — hover a repo to see path, branch, change counts, ahead/behind sync status, remote URL, and last commit with relative date
- **Ahead/behind badges** — `↑N ↓M` shows how many commits you are ahead/behind the remote across all views
- **Visual highlights** — active repo (blue icon + ●), multi-selected (purple check + ✓), repos with changes (yellow), clean repos (green)

### Diff Viewing & Review Workflow
- Click a changed file to open VS Code's **native diff editor** (split view with syntax highlighting)
- **Navigate changed files** — `Ctrl+D, N` / `Shift+N` or ↑↓ buttons in editor title bar to browse files without staging
- **Auto-advance on stage** — staging a file automatically opens the next pending file's diff, enabling a review-then-stage workflow
- **Works from sidebar and editor title bar** — both stage buttons advance to the next file
- **Auto-close stale diffs** — switching to a repo with no changes closes the previous repo's diff
- **Context restore** — switching back to a repo reopens the last file you were viewing (changes take priority over remembered files)
- **Multi-repo diff webview** — aggregated diffs across multiple selected repos with react-diff-view
- Per-file stage/unstage controls in the diff view
- **Inline blame** — GitLens-style current-line blame showing author, date, and commit message (`Ctrl+D, G` to toggle)

### Git Operations
- **Stage / Unstage** individual files or all files (inline buttons + context menu + editor title bar)
- **Discard changes** — revert a single file or all changes with confirmation dialog
- **Commit** with message input box
- **Push** with progress notification
- **Pull** with progress notification (`Ctrl+D, U`)
- **Bulk commit/push** across multiple selected repos

### Branch & Stash Management
- **Branch Switcher** (`Ctrl+D, B`) — QuickPick listing all local branches with current branch marked, plus "Create new branch..." option
- **Stash Management** (`Ctrl+D, A`) — stash push (with message), list stashes, pop latest, apply specific stash, view stash diffs
- **Commit History** (`Ctrl+D, H`) — QuickPick showing last 15 commits, select to view full diff in editor

### Search & Navigation
- **Search in Repo** (`Ctrl+D, /`) — live git grep QuickPick scoped to the selected repo, opens file at matched line
- **Search Active Repos** (`Ctrl+D, .`) — git grep across all recent/active repos with `[repo-name]` badges
- **Search All Repos** (`Ctrl+D, Shift+/`) — git grep across every scanned repo
- Selecting a search result from a different repo auto-switches to it (terminal, changed files, everything)
- **Browse Files** (`Ctrl+D, F`) — QuickPick with all files in a repo via `git ls-files`, instant filtering
- **Switch Repo** (`Ctrl+D, R`) — QuickPick sorted by changes, current repo first
- **Open in New Window** (`Ctrl+D, W`) — opens the selected repo in a new VS Code window for full native search

### File Watcher
- Automatic filesystem watching per repo with 500ms debounce
- Status updates in real-time when files change externally (terminal, other editors)
- Falls back to polling at configurable interval (default 10s)
- **Pauses when VS Code loses focus** — no wasted disk reads in the background; refreshes immediately on refocus

### Performance
- **Single shared git instance** — all commands share one GitExecutor with a 500ms TTL cache, eliminating redundant git process spawns
- **Conditional event firing** — tree views only rebuild when data actually changes (~90% fewer rebuilds during idle polling)
- **Batched concurrency** — `refreshAll` and `_refreshLastCommits` limited to 5 concurrent git processes
- **Terminal state caching** — Active Repos only rescans terminals on open/close events

### Status Bar
- **Left**: repo count + total changes (click to open sidebar)
- **Right**: active repo name + branch + changes with prominent background (click to switch repo)

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `diffchestrator.scanRoots` | `[]` | Root directories to scan for repos |
| `diffchestrator.scanMaxDepth` | `6` | Maximum directory depth for scanning |
| `diffchestrator.scanExtraSkipDirs` | `[]` | Additional directory names to skip |
| `diffchestrator.scanOnStartup` | `true` | Auto-scan configured roots on VS Code start |
| `diffchestrator.changedOnlyDefault` | `false` | Show only changed repos by default |

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension (F5 to run in development, or package with `vsce`)
2. Add your project root to settings:
   ```json
   {
     "diffchestrator.scanRoots": ["/home/user/projects"]
   }
   ```
   Or just open a folder — the extension auto-detects workspace folders if no roots are configured.
3. The extension auto-scans on startup and populates the sidebar
4. Click a repo to see its changed files, click a file to see the diff
5. Use `Ctrl+D, C` to AI commit with Claude, `Ctrl+D, L` to open Claude Code

## Release

```bash
npm run release          # Auto-detect bump from conventional commits
npm run release:patch    # Force patch bump
npm run release:minor    # Force minor bump
npm run release:major    # Force major bump
```

The release script reads commit messages since the last `v*` tag, picks the semver bump (`feat:` = minor, `fix:` = patch, `BREAKING CHANGE` = major), commits the version bump, tags, builds, and packages the `.vsix`.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd webview-ui && npm install && cd ..

# Build
npm run build          # Extension + webview
npm run compile        # Extension only
npm run build:webview  # Webview only

# Debug
# Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Host
```

## Tech Stack

- **Extension**: TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, esbuild
- **Git**: `child_process.execFile` (no shell=true)
- **Webview**: React 19, Vite, react-diff-view
- **AI**: Claude Code CLI integration
- **No backend server** — everything runs in-process via the VS Code extension host
