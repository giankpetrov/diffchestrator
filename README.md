# Diffchestrator — VS Code Extension

> **Built for Claude Code.** Multi-repo Git orchestration designed as a companion to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Anthropic's CLI for agentic coding. Stage, review, and commit across repos without leaving VS Code, then hand off to Claude for AI-powered commits, code reviews, and multi-repo workflows.

## Why Diffchestrator?

Claude Code works best when you can see what it changed, across every repo it touched. Diffchestrator gives you that visibility: a sidebar tree of all your repos, real-time change tracking, one-click diffs, and direct terminal integration with `claude`. No context switching, no manual `git status` in twelve terminals.

## Diffchestrator vs Multi-Root Workspaces

VS Code's multi-root workspaces let you group repos into a `.code-workspace` file for unified file browsing and search. Diffchestrator takes a different approach:

| | Multi-Root Workspaces | Diffchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Manually add each repo to a `.code-workspace` file | Auto-discovers all repos under a root directory |
| **View** | File explorer with folders side-by-side | Git-first tree sorted by changes, with branch, ahead/behind, stash counts, and tags |
| **Scale** | Gets unwieldy beyond ~10 repos | Designed for 20–100+ repos with changed-only filter and tag-based filtering |
| **Switching** | Static set of repos | Switch between project groups instantly (`Alt+D, Shift+S`) |
| **Focus** | Navigate and edit code | Orchestrate git operations — stage, commit, push, search, and review across repos |
| **AI** | No built-in integration | Per-repo Claude Code terminals, AI commits, multi-repo Claude sessions |
| **Cross-repo ops** | Manual per-repo git | Bulk commit/push, git grep across repos, branch cleanup, activity log |

They're complementary — you can use Diffchestrator inside a multi-root workspace. A workspace says "here are my repos." Diffchestrator says "here's what changed, where, and lets you act on it."

## Features

### Claude Code Integration
- **AI Commit** — runs `claude --permission-mode acceptEdits` in the repo's terminal for real-time output (`Alt+D, C`)
- **Open Claude Code** — launches `claude -c` to continue the previous session, or `claude --add-dir` for multiple selected repos (`Alt+D, L`)
- **Yolo** — opens terminal and runs the `yolo` alias from claude-sandbox (`Alt+D, Y`)
- **Claude Multi-Repo Review** — opens Claude with `--add-dir` for all repos with changes and a review prompt
- **Ask Claude** button per diff hunk in the multi-repo diff webview
- **Per-repo terminal tracking** — each repo tracks its own Claude, Yolo, and shell terminals independently. Switching repos auto-switches the terminal panel to the correct session
- **Terminal reuse** — `Alt+D, L` and `Alt+D, Y` reuse existing sessions instead of spawning new ones
- **CLI validation** — checks that `claude` and `docker` are installed before launching terminals

### Active Repos & Workspace Switching
- **Active Repos view** — unified sidebar section showing favorites (star icons) + recent repos (MRU, up to 10) with live terminal status indicators
- **Toggle favorites** — star button in Active Repos title bar shows/hides favorites (filled star = visible, empty star = hidden). Hidden favorites that are active/recent remain visible as their non-favorite role
- **Persisted across reloads** — active repos, selection, and current scan root survive VS Code restarts
- **Cycle repos** — `Alt+D, Tab` cycles through all opened repos including favorites, switching the changed files view, terminal, and diff editor in one keystroke
- **Close active repos** — `Alt+D, Q` closes current, `Alt+D, Shift+Q` picks which to close, `Alt+D, Shift+Tab` closes all
- **Terminal indicators** — each repo shows which terminal types are running (Claude, Yolo, Shell)
- **Auto-switch terminal** — clicking a repo in Active Repos or Repositories auto-surfaces that repo's terminal (priority: Claude > Yolo > Shell)
- **Terminal tab sync** — clicking a terminal tab (Claude, Yolo, shell) auto-selects the repo in the sidebar, opens its changed files, and adds it to Active Repos if not already there
- **Auto-add on terminal open** — opening a terminal, Claude Code, or Yolo session for a repo automatically adds it to Active Repos
- **Smart notifications** — notifies when Claude commits or modifies files. Queues notifications when VS Code is unfocused and shows a grouped summary on refocus. Commit notifications offer "Push" and "Show Terminal" actions
- **Workspace snapshots** — save/load named profiles of your root, favorites, and recent repos

### Repository Discovery & Organization
- **Auto-scan** a root directory to discover all git repos (BFS, configurable depth)
- **Switch scan root** — `Alt+D, Shift+S` quick pick dropdown to switch between configured roots; also available as a button in the Repositories title bar
- **Root name in view titles** — Active Repos and Repositories views show the current root name
- **Auto-scan workspace folders** on startup if no roots configured, and when new folders are added
- **Skip directories** like `node_modules`, `.terraform`, `vendor`, `build`, etc. (configurable)
- **Changed-only filter** — toggle to show only repos with uncommitted changes (`Alt+D, D`)
- **Changed repos sort first** in the tree for quick access
- **Progress indication** — shows scanning/refreshing progress in the status bar for large repo counts
- **Repo tags** — tag repos with labels (e.g., `frontend`, `infra`, `shared`), then filter the tree by tag with `Alt+D, I`. Tags appear as `#tag` in repo descriptions
- **Bulk fetch** — fetch all repos at once from the Repositories title bar; distinguishes local-only repos from real failures
- **Bulk pull** — pull all repos that are behind remote with confirmation
- **Auto-fetch on scan** — optionally run `git fetch` during scan for accurate ahead/behind counts

### Sidebar Views (3 sections)
- **Active Repos** — favorites (yellow/blue stars) + recently opened repos with terminal status, active repo highlighted in blue. Pin repos with `Alt+D, E`
- **Changed Files** — staged/unstaged/untracked files for the selected repo, grouped by status. Shows diff stats (`+N -M`) per file
- **Repositories** — hierarchical tree with common path prefix collapsing, change count badges, tag indicators, root switcher button
- **View descriptions** — active repo name + branch shown next to "Changed Files" title; root name + tag filter + repo count next to "Repositories"
- **Activity bar badge** — total change count across all repos
- **Tooltips** — hover a repo to see path, branch, change counts, ahead/behind sync status, stash count, remote URL, and last commit with relative date
- **Ahead/behind badges** — `↑N ↓M` shows how many commits you are ahead/behind the remote across all views
- **Health badges** — orange cloud icon for repos behind remote, archive icon with count for stashes
- **Visual highlights** — active repo (blue icon + ●), multi-selected (purple check + ✓), repos with changes (yellow), behind remote (orange), clean repos (green)

### Diff Viewing & Review Workflow
- Click a changed file to open VS Code's **native diff editor** (split view with syntax highlighting)
- **Navigate changed files** — `Alt+D, N` / `Shift+N` or ↑↓ buttons in editor title bar to browse files without staging
- **Auto-advance on stage** — staging a file automatically opens the next pending file's diff, enabling a review-then-stage workflow
- **Works from sidebar and editor title bar** — both stage buttons advance to the next file
- **Auto-close stale diffs** — switching to a repo with no changes closes the previous repo's diff; committing a repo's last change auto-closes the diff tab
- **Auto-refresh diffs** — diff content refreshes after CLI commits (no stale content)
- **Context restore** — switching back to a repo reopens the last file you were viewing (changes take priority over remembered files)
- **Multi-repo diff webview** — aggregated diffs across multiple selected repos with react-diff-view
- Per-file stage/unstage controls in the diff view
- **Inline blame** — GitLens-style current-line blame showing author, date, and commit message (`Alt+D, G` to toggle)

### Git Operations
- **Stage / Unstage** individual files or all files (inline buttons + context menu + editor title bar)
- **Discard changes** — revert a single file, delete an untracked file, or discard all changes with confirmation dialog
- **Commit** with conventional commit prefix picker (feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs/test/ci) (`Alt+D, M`)
- **Undo last commit** (`Alt+D, Z`) — soft reset keeping changes staged, with confirmation showing the commit message
- **Auto-push after commit** — optionally push immediately after a successful commit
- **Push** with progress notification (`Alt+D, P`)
- **Pull** with progress notification (`Alt+D, U`)
- **Fetch** — single-repo fetch via right-click context menu, or bulk fetch all from title bar
- **Bulk commit/push** across multiple selected repos
- **Copy repo info** — right-click to copy path, branch, remote URL, or name to clipboard
- **Open remote URL** — right-click to open the repo's GitHub/GitLab page in browser (auto-converts `git@` SSH URLs to HTTPS)
- **Reveal in file explorer** — open the repo folder in your system file manager (`Alt+D, O`)
- **Swap repo** — jump back to the previous repo across roots (`Alt+D, Backspace`)
- **Git detection** — shows error with install link if git isn't available on PATH

### Branch & Stash Management
- **Branch Switcher** (`Alt+D, B`) — QuickPick listing all local branches with current branch marked, plus "Create new branch..." option
- **Branch Cleanup** (`Alt+D, X`) — find merged branches across all repos and delete them in bulk
- **Stash Management** (`Alt+D, A`) — stash push (with message), list stashes, pop latest, apply specific stash, view stash diffs
- **Commit History** (`Alt+D, H`) — QuickPick showing last 15 commits, select to view full diff in editor
- **Cross-repo Activity Log** — recent commits across ALL repos sorted by date

### Search & Navigation
- **Search in Repo** (`Alt+D, /`) — live git grep QuickPick scoped to the selected repo, opens file at matched line
- **Search Active Repos** (`Alt+D, .`) — git grep across all recent/active repos with `[repo-name]` badges
- **Search All Repos** (`Alt+D, Shift+/`) — git grep across every scanned repo
- Selecting a search result from a different repo auto-switches to it (terminal, changed files, everything)
- **Browse Files** (`Alt+D, F`) — QuickPick with all files in a repo via `git ls-files`, instant filtering
- **Switch Repo** (`Alt+D, R`) — QuickPick sorted by changes, current repo first
- **Open in New Window** (`Alt+D, W`) — opens the selected repo in a new VS Code window for full native search

### File Watcher
- Watches `.git/` directories per repo (HEAD, index, refs changes) with 500ms debounce
- Status updates in real-time when commits, staging, or branch changes occur
- Auto-suppresses after explicit operations (stage/commit) to avoid redundant refreshes
- Falls back to polling at configurable interval (default 10s)
- **Pauses when VS Code loses focus** — no wasted disk reads in the background; refreshes immediately on refocus

### Performance
- **Single shared git instance** — all commands share one GitExecutor with request deduplication (concurrent calls share one Promise) and a 1s TTL cache
- **Lazy activation** — extension defers loading until the sidebar is opened or VS Code finishes startup
- **Smart file watching** — watches `.git/` directories only (not `**/*`), with automatic suppression after explicit refreshes to avoid double updates
- **Event coalescing** — rapid repo-change events are batched into a single tick, preventing cascading tree rebuilds during scan
- **Conditional event firing** — tree views only rebuild when data actually changes (~90% fewer rebuilds during idle polling)
- **Batched concurrency** — `refreshAll` and scan limited to 5-10 concurrent git processes with progress indication
- **Terminal state caching** — Active Repos only rescans terminals on open/close events
- **Status bar debounce** — consolidates multiple rapid updates into one render

### Dashboard (`Alt+D, V`)
A full command center with three tabs. Also available from the Repositories title bar. Auto-refreshes every 2 seconds when repos change.

**Dashboard tab** — four sections:
- **Sync Overview** — table with ahead/behind/changes/stashes, color-coded rows, sortable columns. Per-repo actions: pull, push, AI commit, discard, switch branch, commit history, open in browser, copy info, terminal, Claude Code. Bulk actions: Fetch All, Pull N outdated, Push N ahead
- **Branch Map** — repos grouped by main vs feature branches, with pills per branch name. Branch Cleanup button to find and delete merged branches
- **Change Heatmap** — tile grid with heat levels (hot/warm/mild/stale/quiet) based on changes + days since last commit
- **Session Summary** — commits since VS Code session start, grouped by repo (works with external CLIs too)

Header actions: Switch Root, Filter by Tag, Claude Review All, Save/Load Snapshot, Scan, Refresh

**Activity tab** — cross-repo commit timeline sorted by date, grouped by day. Shows hash, repo name, message, author, and relative time across all repos.

**Shortcuts tab** — full keyboard shortcut reference with all `Alt+D` chords.

### Status Bar
- **Left**: repo count + total changes (click to open sidebar)
- **Right**: active repo name + branch + changes with prominent background (click to switch repo)

### Extension API

Diffchestrator exposes a public API for sibling extensions (e.g., Epic Lens):

```typescript
interface DiffchestratorApi {
  getCurrentRoot(): string | undefined;
  getSelectedRepo(): string | undefined;
  onDidChangeSelection: vscode.Event<void>;
}
```

Consume it from another extension:

```typescript
const diffchestrator = vscode.extensions.getExtension("andrevops-com.diffchestrator");
const api = diffchestrator?.exports as DiffchestratorApi;
api?.onDidChangeSelection(() => {
  console.log("Selection changed:", api.getSelectedRepo());
});
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andrevops-com.diffchestrator), [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/andrevops/diffchestrator), or build locally with `make package && make install`.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Add scan roots** — tell Diffchestrator where your repos live. Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,`) and add one or more root directories:
   ```json
   {
     "diffchestrator.scanRoots": ["/home/user/projects"]
   }
   ```
   You can add multiple roots (e.g., work projects + personal projects). Switch between them with `Alt+D, Shift+S`.

   > **Tip:** If you skip this step, Diffchestrator auto-detects repos in your open workspace folders.

2. **Scan** — press `Alt+D, S` or open the Diffchestrator sidebar (click the icon in the Activity Bar). Repos populate automatically on startup if `scanOnStartup` is enabled (default: `true`).

3. **Select a repo** — click any repo in the **Repositories** view. The **Changed Files** panel shows its staged/unstaged/untracked files. Click a file to open the native diff editor.

4. **Optional: Enable fetch on scan** — for accurate ahead/behind counts, enable auto-fetch:
   ```json
   {
     "diffchestrator.fetchOnScan": true
   }
   ```
   This runs `git fetch` for each repo during scan. Disable if you have many repos or slow network.

5. **Optional: Configure Claude Code** — if you use Claude Code, the default permission mode for AI commits is `acceptEdits`. Change it in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "diffchestrator.claudePermissionMode": "acceptEdits"
   }
   ```
   Options: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `full`.

### Quick Tour

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Scan repos | `Alt+D, S` |
| Switch repo | `Alt+D, R` |
| View changed files + diff | Click a repo |
| AI commit with Claude | `Alt+D, C` |
| Open Claude Code | `Alt+D, L` |
| Commit with message | `Alt+D, M` |
| Push | `Alt+D, P` |
| Open Dashboard | `Alt+D, V` |
| Show all shortcuts | `Alt+D, K` |

## Release

```bash
make release          # Auto-detect bump from conventional commits
make release-patch    # Force patch bump
make release-minor    # Force minor bump
make release-major    # Force major bump
make install          # Install latest .vsix locally
make publish          # Publish to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX
make publish-marketplace  # Publish to VS Code Marketplace only
make publish-openvsx      # Publish to Open VSX only
make clean            # Remove build artifacts
```

The release script reads commit messages since the last `v*` tag, picks the semver bump (`feat:` = minor, `fix:` = patch, `BREAKING CHANGE` = major), updates CHANGELOG.md, commits the version bump, tags, builds, and packages two `.vsix` files:
- `diffchestrator-X.Y.Z.vsix` — VS Code Marketplace (publisher: `andrevops-com`)
- `diffchestrator-X.Y.Z-openvsx.vsix` — Open VSX Registry (publisher: `andrevops`)

Pushing a `v*` tag to GitHub triggers CI to create a GitHub Release with both files and auto-publish to Open VSX.

## Tech Stack

- **Extension**: TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, esbuild
- **Git**: `child_process.execFile` (no shell=true)
- **Webview**: React 19, Vite, react-diff-view
- **AI**: Claude Code CLI integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for building and releasing
- **No backend server** — everything runs in-process via the VS Code extension host
