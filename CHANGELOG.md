### Performance
- Singleton GitExecutor — replace 11 instances with shared `repoManager.git`
- Request deduplication — concurrent `status()` calls share one Promise
- Replace `**/*` file watcher with `.git`-specific `fs.watch` (~95% less noise)
- Event coalescing — batch rapid repo-change events into one tick
- Auto-suppress file watcher after explicit `refreshRepo()` to avoid double refresh
- Status bar debounce (150ms) to consolidate rapid updates
- Add `withProgress` to scan and `refreshAll` for large repo counts
- Increase status cache TTL from 500ms to 1000ms
- Cap `lastOpenFile` Map at 20 entries with LRU eviction
- Add activation events to defer extension load until sidebar is opened

### Other
- Singleton output channel — create once on activation, reuse in commit/push/pull
- Replace AI commit blind `setTimeout` with `fs.watch` on `.git` directory
- Add logging to silent catch blocks
- Extract shared `timeAgo`/`timeAgoShort` utility
- Move tooltip refresh from repo changes to user selection only
- Make `workspaceAutoScan._containsGitRepo` fully async
